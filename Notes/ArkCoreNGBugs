		--Druid trainer Gart Mistrunner (3060) does not work correctly either, Sheal Runetotem (3034) does.
		--Player:PrepareGossipMenu - trainer menu doesn't proc.  GossipMenuItemsMapBounds menuItemBounds has
			missing data.
			Data comes from gossip menu options
			Field in question is called OptionType
		Issue is in conditions.
			SourceTypeOrReferenceID 
				14 = CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_GOSSIP_MENU, gossip_menu.entry, gossip_menu.text_id
				15 = CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_GOSSIP_MENU_OPTION, gossip_menu_option.menu_id, gossip_menu_option.id
			
			ConditionTypeOrReference 
				15 = CONDITION_CLASS, Class Mask from ChrClasses.dbc
					except the data isn't in the dbc, it's just some damn enum in the code.
